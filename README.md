# GPU-Accelerated Image Enhancement using NPP

## Project Description
This project demonstrates high-performance image enhancement using NVIDIA Performance Primitives (NPP) library. It performs various image processing operations like rotation, contrast adjustment, and brightness correction on large image datasets using GPU acceleration.

## Features
- Image rotation (90°, 180°, 270°)
- Contrast enhancement
- Brightness adjustment
- GPU-accelerated processing using CUDA and NPP
- Command-line interface for batch processing

## Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit 11.0+
- NVIDIA NPP library

## Compilation
```bash
make
